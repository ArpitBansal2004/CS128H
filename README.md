Project Introduction:
For this project, we are creating a Sudoko Puzzle solver. The front end will be a website which will contain a 9 by 9 box where the user would be able to enter the starting numbers. After pressing the solve button, the website will run the sudoko solver code and get a solution (if possible) to the puuzle. 

Technical Overview:
The project is divided into 3 major components: 
1. The Sudoko Solver Rust Code
2. Website designing using HTML and CSS
3. Front-end Back-end integration

By checkpoint 1, we plan on creating the website and start with the sudoko solver code. By checkpoint 2, we will complete the sudoko solver code. In the last few days before the final porject submission, we will work on integrating boththe front end and the back end. 


Possible Challenges: 
1. From the logic that we are thinking of using to create the sodoko solver, the runtime of the sudoko solver code is very large. We plan on resolving this by looking into research papers about doing the code differently. One approach we thought of ourselves was giving the code some starting values depending the 3 * 3 box with the most numbers and then running the code on the basis of those values rather than completely randomizing it. 
2. No member of our group knows how to integrate front end with the back end and we will have to do some research on that.
